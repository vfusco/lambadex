# you can see a cartesi machine was created that initializes the lambda.bin
# then processed a bunch of inputs, updated the state, and generated a
# bunch of outputs
make show-input-output
# for example, here is an order that executed
make run-queries
# you can see a new cartesi machine that takes the existing lambda.bin
# and answers queries
make show-query-output
# for example, here is an order book query
make run-queries-jsonrpc
# you can run queries bare-metal using a jsonrpc server in the host!
# it directly uses the lambda.bin that was crated inside the cartesi machine
make run-inputs-host
# in fact, you can create and advance the state in bare-metal!
